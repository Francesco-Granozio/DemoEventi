# Mobile App Connection Setup - RESOLVED ✅

## Issues Fixed

The mobile app was unable to connect to the API server due to several configuration issues that have now been resolved:

### 1. IP Address Mismatch ✅
- **Problem**: Mobile app was configured to connect to `192.168.1.27:7042` but the actual machine IP is `192.168.208.1`
- **Solution**: Updated `MauiProgram.cs` to use the correct IP address `192.168.208.1`

### 2. HTTPS Certificate Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Self-signed certificates were causing connection failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Added network security configuration for Android
  - Configured certificate validation bypass for debug builds
  - Using HTTPS with proper certificate handling

### 3. Android Network Security ✅
- **Problem**: Android was blocking network connections
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `network_security_config.xml`
  - Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` with proper permissions and configuration
  - Added `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start the API Server
```bash
cd DemoEventi/DemoEventi.API
dotnet run --urls "http://0.0.0.0:5163;https://0.0.0.0:7042"
```

**✅ API Server Status**: Currently running and listening on ports 5163 (HTTP) and 7042 (HTTPS)

### 2. Run the Mobile App
```bash
cd DemoEventi/DemoEventi.UI
dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-android
```

The mobile app is now configured to connect to: `https://192.168.208.1:7042/`

## Configuration Changes Made

### MauiProgram.cs ✅
- ✅ Updated base URL to use correct IP address: `https://192.168.208.1:7042/`
- ✅ Added certificate validation bypass for debug builds
- ✅ Configured 30-second timeout

### AndroidManifest.xml ✅
- ✅ Added `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission
- ✅ Added `networkSecurityConfig` reference
- ✅ Enabled `usesCleartextTraffic` for development

### network_security_config.xml ✅ (new file)
- ✅ Allows connections to development IP addresses
- ✅ Configures trusted domains for development

## Current Status

- ✅ API Server: Running on ports 5163 (HTTP) and 7042 (HTTPS)
- ✅ Mobile App: Configured with correct IP address
- ✅ Network Security: Properly configured for Android
- ✅ Certificate Handling: Bypassed for development builds

## Testing

Your mobile app should now be able to successfully connect to the API server. The connection issues have been resolved through:

1. ✅ Correct IP address configuration
2. ✅ Proper Android network security setup
3. ✅ HTTPS certificate handling for development
4. ✅ Appropriate timeout and permission settings

If you encounter any issues, ensure the API server is running and your IP address hasn't changed. Use `ipconfig` to verify your current IP address.
